1. The difference between 2 versions helped because it helped me tell
the difference between them and see what the error was in the newer
one.
2. Having the full history of my old one can tell me where I went wrong
and how I made a crucial mistake at one point.
3. Having manual commits allows you to go back to a point where you've
specifically selected for yourself to view in the future. It's more
clear cut than if auto saves were to dictate your revisions.
4. cuz its important
5. having old states makes you feel safer when you make bold tweaks
that could be game breaking.
